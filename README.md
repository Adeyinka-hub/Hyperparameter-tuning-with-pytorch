This repository contains a notebook showcasing the process of tuning hyperparameters for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classification model created using PyTorch. The central component of this implementation is a library known as **skorch**.

The dataset is available through this [link](https://zindi.africa/competitions/sbtic-animal-classification/data), from a Zindi Afica hackathon. This data is composed of images of two different animal categories, elephant and zebra. The goal is to build an image classifaction model.
The content of this repository is to demonstrate the effect of hyperparameter tuning on neural network models.

Wishing you fruitful learning!
